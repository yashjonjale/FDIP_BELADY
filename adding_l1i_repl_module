The following are functions we need to track

okay so the replacement policy has to update the cache, which means that the corresponding functions also have to a part of it, but we need access to the FTQ for the replacment policy? which is defined in the l1i_prefetcher.cc and I want to accesss it in l1i_replacement.cc

so how do we do this ??


For a first lets just forget ftq, lets just do this without it 

replicate llc_replacement exactly for l1i_replacement

add_victim
update_replcaement_state
initialise
final stats


added else if conditions for the first two at corresondng places blocking the default replacement policy



Now to implement belady, a little bit tricky but some jugaad needed here
